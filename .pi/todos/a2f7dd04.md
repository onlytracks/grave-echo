When a player picks up an item and the corresponding equipment slot is empty, automatically equip it. This should work for all equipment types (weapons, armor, accessories, etc.), not just weapons.

Current behavior: Only the first weapon pickup auto-equips.
Desired behavior: Any equippable item auto-equips if the target slot is unoccupied.

This should follow the universal entity system — no special-case player code. The auto-equip logic should key off component data (equipment slot type) rather than item category hardcoding.
