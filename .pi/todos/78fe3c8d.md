## Goal
Replace plain ASCII glyphs for entities and items with more evocative Unicode glyphs.
The game currently uses basic ASCII (`@`, `g`, `/`, `)`, `!`) which is functional but
visually flat. Unicode roguelike glyphs add personality without changing any game logic.

## Glyph Reference
Consult this curated Unicode roguelike reference for glyph ideas:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/globalcitizen/zomia/master/USEFUL-UNICODE.md

**Important:** Only use single-width glyphs that render correctly in common monospace
terminal fonts (e.g., JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, Menlo, Consolas). Some Unicode glyphs
from the reference render as double-width or missing in certain fonts. Test each glyph
in the actual game terminal before committing.

## Existing Code Context

### Current Glyphs
All glyph assignments are in these files:

**Player** (`src/index.ts`):
- `@` — player (brightWhite on black)

**Enemies** (`src/index.ts`):
- `g` — goblin (red on black)

**Items** (`src/items/item-factory.ts`):
- `/` — Iron Sword (white on black)
- `)` — Short Bow (yellow on black)
- `!` — Healing Potion (brightRed on black)

**Item drop rendering** (`src/ecs/systems/inventory.ts`):
- `drop()` function reconstructs Renderable when dropping items. Uses `charMap` and
  `fgMap` lookup tables keyed by `weaponType`. Update these maps to match new glyphs.

**Tiles** (`src/map/game-map.ts`):
- `·` — floor (gray on black) — already Unicode, keep as-is
- `#` — wall (gray on black) — may already be updated to box-drawing by TODO-e050938b

### Renderable Component (`src/ecs/components.ts`)
```typescript
interface Renderable {
  char: string;  // the glyph
  fg: string;
  bg: string;
}
```

## Requirements

### Choose New Glyphs
Select glyphs from the reference that are evocative and distinguishable at a glance.
Suggested replacements (adjust based on what renders well in testing):

**Player:**
- `@` → keep `@` — it's the universal roguelike player glyph, iconic

**Enemies:**
- `g` goblin → `ġ` or `g` with a more distinct color. Or pick from the reference's
  monster section. Must be visually distinct from items and terrain.

**Weapons:**
- `/` sword → `†` (dagger/sword from reference: ᚋ/Ϯ/ϯ/†) or `⚔` if single-width
- `)` bow → `༼` or `}` (bow from reference: ༼/༽)

**Consumables:**
- `!` healing potion → `Ꭳ` (potion from reference) or `♥` or `❤` for healing specifically

### Update Files
1. `src/index.ts` — player and goblin Renderable glyphs
2. `src/items/item-factory.ts` — item Renderable glyphs
3. `src/ecs/systems/inventory.ts` — `charMap` and `fgMap` in `drop()` function must
   match the new glyphs so dropped items render correctly

### Verify Consistency
Every place a glyph is hardcoded must use the same glyph for the same entity/item type.
Search for all `char:` assignments and ensure consistency:
```bash
grep -rn "char:" src/ --include="*.ts"
```

### Color Improvements
While updating glyphs, also consider improving foreground colors to be more thematic:
- Healing potion: `brightGreen` (healing = green) instead of `brightRed`
- Bow: keep `yellow` or try `brightYellow`
- Sword: keep `white` or try `brightCyan` for a steel gleam

## Design Constraints
- Single-width glyphs only — double-width breaks the grid
- Must be distinguishable from each other and from terrain at a glance
- Must render in common monospace terminal fonts (test in the actual game)
- Player stays `@` — don't change this
- No game logic changes — this is purely visual (Renderable.char and colors only)
- Keep the `char` field name as-is (it's idiomatic, see AGENTS.md terminology)

## Tests
No automated tests — visual concern. Verify manually:
- All glyphs render as single-width (don't break grid alignment)
- Each entity/item type is visually distinguishable
- Dropped items use the correct glyph (matches pickup glyph)
- Fog of war dimming works with new glyphs
- Debug panel entity display still works (shows glyph in enemy listing)

## Definition of Done
- Entity and item glyphs are updated to more evocative Unicode glyphs
- All glyph assignments are consistent across files
- Dropped items render with the correct new glyph
- All glyphs are single-width and render correctly in the game terminal
- `bun test` still passes (no regressions)
