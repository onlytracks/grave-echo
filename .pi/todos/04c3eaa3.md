## Problem
Wall glyphs (box-drawing characters like │ ─ ┌ ┐ └ ┘ ├ ┤ ┬ ┴ ┼ ■) are extremely hard
to see. They're thin lines rendered in "gray" on "black" — nearly invisible.

## Current State
- `src/map/game-map.ts` — `WALL_TILE` defaults to `char: "#", fg: "gray", bg: "black"`
- `src/map/tile-utils.ts` — `assignWallCharacters()` replaces `#` with box-drawing glyphs
  based on neighbor adjacency (16 cases using NSEW bitmask)
- Floor tiles use `·` in gray — walls need strong visual contrast against floors

## Fix
Replace the box-drawing glyph set with solid block glyphs like `▓` (dark shade U+2593)
or `█` (full block U+2588). Two approaches:

**Option A (simple):** Use a single glyph `▓` for all walls. Loses directional info but
maximizes visibility. Could brighten the fg color too (e.g. "white" or "cyan").

**Option B (hybrid):** Use `▓` as the base wall glyph but keep directional box-drawing
for wall edges adjacent to floor (so doorways/corners still read well). Interior walls
use solid blocks.

Recommend Option A — the game grid is small enough that shape distinction isn't critical,
and visibility is the priority. Also bump fg from "gray" to "white" or a brighter color.

## Files to Change
- `src/map/tile-utils.ts` — update `charMap` values (or simplify to single glyph)
- `src/map/game-map.ts` — update `WALL_TILE` default char and possibly fg color
- Tests in `src/map/__tests__/` may reference specific wall chars
