## Goal
The encumbrance system already works (`getEncumbrancePenalty()` in `src/ecs/systems/turn.ts`
reduces movement at 50/75/100% weight). But the player has no visual feedback that they're
being penalized. Show the encumbrance state in the PlayerStats panel.

## What Exists
- `src/ecs/systems/turn.ts`: `getEncumbrancePenalty(world, entity)` returns 0/1/2/Infinity
- `src/renderer/panels/player-stats.ts`: already shows `Weight: X/Y (Z%)` on the last line

## Changes
In `src/renderer/panels/player-stats.ts`, update the weight line to show penalty status
with color coding:

| Threshold | Display | Color |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| 0-50% | `Weight: 6/30 (20%)` | gray |
| 50-75% | `Weight: 18/30 (60%) -1 spd` | yellow |
| 75-100% | `Weight: 25/30 (83%) -2 spd` | brightRed |
| 100%+ | `Weight: 32/30 (107%) IMMOBILE` | red |

Import `getEncumbrancePenalty` from turn.ts and use it to determine color and suffix.

## Files to Change
- `src/renderer/panels/player-stats.ts` — ~5 lines changed

## Definition of Done
- Weight line color reflects encumbrance tier
- Penalty shown as `-1 spd` / `-2 spd` / `IMMOBILE`
- `bun test` passes
