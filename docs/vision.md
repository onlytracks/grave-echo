# Grave Echo — Game Vision

## Concept

Grave Echo is a roguelite action RPG set in a dark, magic-saturated world being consumed by a
creeping corruption. The player is a competent adventurer — not a raw recruit, not a legendary
hero — who must journey from the corrupted wilds through ancient ruins and into the deep crypts
where the source of evil festers. Each death imprints an Echo on the land, leaving behind a
skeleton that future runs may discover. The adventurer retains their hard-won experience and
strength, but all gear is lost. The world is procedurally generated but follows a structured
act-based journey, blending authored pacing with emergent discovery.

## Core Fantasy

You are the last line of defense between an ancient, spreading evil and everything you love.
The world you traverse was once magnificent — grand cities, sacred temples, deep libraries of
forgotten knowledge — now twisted and corrupted. You press deeper not for glory but necessity.
The magic in these places is real and tangible, found in relics and artifacts that crackle with
power. Death is not the end; the land itself remembers you, and your bones mark the path for
your next attempt.

## Design Pillars

1. **Death Is Progress** — Every death makes the adventurer permanently stronger through
   retained experience. Gear is lost, but your strength, health, and skill upgrades persist.
   Your skeletons litter the world as echoes of past attempts — find them to reclaim degraded
   remnants of what you once carried.

2. **Earned Mastery** — The world rewards exploration and knowledge. The hub must be discovered.
   The best gear must be found. Nothing is handed to you.

3. **Authored Pacing, Emergent Content** — Every run follows the same narrative arc
   (wilds → city → depths) but the specifics are always new. The rhythm is designed; the
   details are discovered.

4. **Dark Wonder** — The tone is gothic and atmospheric, but not nihilistic. Ancient magic is
   beautiful and terrifying. Moments of levity are rare and land hard — bright spots that make
   the darkness feel earned.

5. **Meaningful Choice** — Push deeper or return to the hub? Risk your best gear or leave it
   stashed? Explore a side crypt or press the main path? Every decision has weight.

## What Makes This Different?

The Echo system — death leaves your skeleton in the world, carrying degraded remnants of your
gear. Up to 10 past skeletons persist, older ones with increasingly degraded equipment. Combined
with a discovered hub that serves as a persistent base, stash, and merchant, Grave Echo blends
roguelite progression with Diablo-style loot management and base-building.

|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Stormlight Archive  | Grand scope, hard magic, tonal balance, wonder  | Sprawling length, dozens of POV characters|
| Hades               | Meta-progression feel, "death is progress"      | Fixed map, act-skipping mechanics         |
| Diablo              | Hub, stash, merchant, loot-driven gameplay      | Always-online, endless endgame grind      |
| Dark Souls          | Gothic atmosphere, corpse runs, environmental storytelling | Extreme punishment, obtuse mechanics |
| Slay the Spire      | Act structure, run variety                      | Card-based combat, non-spatial gameplay   |

## Target Experience

- **Session length:** ~1 hour for a full successful run
- **Difficulty feel:** Fair but tough. Deaths should feel like learning moments, not cheap shots.
  The player should think "I know what to do differently" not "that was unfair."
- **Tone:** Dark gothic wonder with sparse, punchy levity. Crumbling cathedrals lit by ancient
  magic. A gallows-humor inscription on a tomb. Hope is rare and precious.
- **Audience:** Players who enjoy roguelites and action RPGs. Fans of Hades, Dead Cells, and
  Diablo who want a darker, more atmospheric experience with permadeath stakes and a clear
  narrative goal.

## Open Questions

- How does the corruption visually/mechanically manifest in the overworld?
- What is the source of the evil? (Defines the final boss and narrative climax)
- NPC interactions — any persistent characters beyond the merchant?
- Multiplayer — ever, or strictly single-player?
